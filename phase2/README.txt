-Syntax Analysis is implemented using YACC/Bison program in C, following the grammar of Alpha Programming Language.
-There are no conflicts in our grammar, except of the ifelse conflict.
-The scope rules are working as intended, based on the FAQ and the Labs.
-Some logical error checkings are also implemented (to our knowledge this is not something asked to be implemented in this phase).
-In the folder "testMains" there are some test programs we created to test our data structures. They show their functionality and usage very well.

-Phase_2 was tested on 'portokali'.
